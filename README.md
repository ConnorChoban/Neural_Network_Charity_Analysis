# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning concepts to create a neural network to examine whether applicants will successfully meet the criteria to receive funding from a charity organization. In this analysis, we'll create a complex neural network and make modifications in an attempt to correctly classify the data 75% of the time.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- In our code, we tried to classify applicants by whether their applications were successful or not. Therefore, we used the column "IS_SUCCESSFUL" as our target variable. 
- The features for our model consist of all additional columns besides the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column and the EIN and NAME which were dropped. 
- In our code we dropped EIN and NAME as they serve for identification purposes and don't have an impact on the data. 

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

-
- I was not able to acheive the target model performance (75%), but I did managed to acheive an accuracy score as high as approximately 74.3%.
